WeWeb Email

The WeWeb Email plugin was developed to allow you to add an email component to your app quickly and securely **at the beginning of a project**.

This plugin will let you send an email through an action in a workflow:

However, as your project grows, you will quickly feel limited because:
- you can't customize the sender,
- you can only send text, and
- a maximum of 10 emails/hour.

As you scale your app, you will want to transition to a dedicated email integration via your backend. For example, you could work with Xano's Sendgrid extension or configure Supabase to send emails. 

No matter what backend and email service you choose, you will be able to use WeWeb workflows to trigger those emails.
