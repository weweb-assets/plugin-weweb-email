# How to configure the WeWeb Email plugin

There is nothing to configure for this plugin. 

Since you added the plugin to your project, you now have access to the [`Send an email` action in no-code workflows](https://docs.weweb.io/plugins/extensions/weweb-email.html#send-email).

## Warning

The WeWeb Email plugin was developed to allow you to add an email component to your app quickly and securely **at the beginning of a project**.

However, as your project grows, you will quickly feel limited because:
- you can't customize the sender,
- you can only send text, and
- a maximum of 10 emails/hour.

As you scale your app, you will want to transition to a dedicated email integration via your backend. For example, you could work with Xano's Sendgrid extension or configure Supabase to send emails. 

No matter what backend and email service you choose, you will be able to use WeWeb workflows to trigger those emails.
